## About
The toolbox was created at the request of artists to make their lives easier when creating assets for projects. Toolbox is currently in alpha testing.

## Two main objectives
1. The toolbox must have all the main tools artists use daily
2. The toolbox must be easy to use and easy to install

## Using the toolbox
To use the toolbox an artist must first create a button on their custom Maya shelf and set that button to work with Python, not MEL, once set up the user can simply click the assigned button, a window will pop up with the most used tools. 

The tools vary from drop-down boxes to checkboxes to buttons.
  
## Installing and Importing a .pyc file
1. To **install** the toolbox.pyc file navigate to your scripts folder (Drive:\Users\[Name]\Documents\maya\[Version]\scripts)
2. **Copy and Paste** toolbox.pyc into the scripts folder.
3. Launch / Restart Maya.
4. In Maya, open a **Python Tab** in the **Script Editor** and execute:
5. **import toolbox as tb** _and_ **tb.TB_Window()** in the same tab

## Why create a toolbox
Artists only have so much time during the day and having to repeat tasks that can be automated daily is never a fun idea, this is where the toolbox steps in by putting all the most used tools in one place saving artists time and allowing for a more efficient asset creation pipeline.
